Regular Expression patterns for the design contest live here:

  - all.N.mandatory.pat     Regular Expressions that must be run on all 
                            streams, /regardless/ of category.
  - all.N.optional.pat      Regular Expressions that can be run on all 
                            streams, for extra points.
  - FOO.category.pat        Regular Expression which identifies the FOO category
  - FOO.N.mandatory.pat     Regular Expression N which must be run on streams
                            of the FOO category.
  - FOO.N.optional.pat      Regular Expressions that can be run on streams of
                            the FOO category for extra points.
  - other.optional/         Other categories that can be implemented for 
                            bonus points. Beyond categorization no further
                            regular expressions need to be run on them (beyond
                            the ones which are run on all streams).

* Regular Expressions were adapted from l7-filter and snort.
* Regular Expressions in some cases have been simplified for the contest. They
  are no longer meant to be used "in the wild."
* Our Regular Expression parser is case-sensitive, and greedy. The 
  repeat-N-times operator {N} has been inlined away. \d has been replaced with
  [0-9]. \s has been replaced with [\x20\x09\x0a\x0b\x0d]. Spaces have been
  replaced with \x20. ^ and $ have been removed, not because they don't work,
  but to intentionally make the patterns more expensive to implement.
